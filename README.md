# TechWise-Project2-ML
This project, the machine learning component of Techwise Project 2, aims to predict student dropout or graduation using machine learning models.

Introduction:

This project, the machine learning component of Techwise Project 2, focuses on predicting student dropout or graduation outcomes using machine learning models. The initial dataset, related to student performance, was replaced with a student dropout dataset due to the synthetic nature of the original data. This project aims to analyze various student-related features to build predictive models that can identify potential dropout risks early on, enabling timely intervention and support.

This project consists of two Colab Notebooks. One contains the main Machine Learning code, and the other one contains the code for the ANN(Artificial Neural Network) model.

Project Goals:

Develop effective machine learning models to accurately predict student dropout and graduation outcomes.
Analyze the key factors that influence student dropout.
Provide a code repository and models for future research and applications.

Project Contents:

Data Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and other steps to optimize model performance.
Model Development and Training: Involves training and comparing various machine learning models, including (but not limited to) Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Artificial Neural Networks.

Model Evaluation: Uses various evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to assess model performance.
Data Visualization: Visualizes the data to enhance understanding.
This project has 2 Colab Notebooks.
